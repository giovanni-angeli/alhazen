# This is to document the way a material is tagged for modeling.
# Optical models produce the equivalent of a "material_file_name".
# Therefore, to say that a material is modeled, we decided to put the value
# "modelled" for the "material_file_name" key. This can even be part of an
# EMA (though usually it is not).
